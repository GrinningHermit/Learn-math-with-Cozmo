What does it do exactly?
-
After you pick a type of math to learn and a range, Cozmo offers a series of math questions that need to be answered on screen. This can be either the computer from which the program was started or a (mobile) device inside the local network.

This program offers a choice of match training sets (pic 1). Once a choice is made, Cozmo asks a number of questions (pic 2). The answer can be entered on screen (pic 3). Cozmo tells you itâ€™s ok or not (pic 4). This repeats ten times with questions within the chosen range and math type, then ends with a celebration.

There is a similar script available for the other Anki robot, Vector: https://github.com/GrinningHermit/Learn-math-with-Vector

What do you need to use it?
-
1. Cozmo himself (http://anki.com/cozmo)
2. A computer
3. A little knowledge about Python
4. Knowledge of the Cozmo SDK (http://cozmosdk.anki.com/docs)
5. The files in this repository
6. The python module Pillow. (pip3 install --user Pillow, usually already installed when working with the Cozmo SDK)
7. The python module Flask. (pip3 install --user flask)

If you know how to run an example file from the Cozmo SDK, you should be able to run this script. 

System requirements
-
- Computer with Windows OS, mac OSX or Linux
- Python 3.6.1 or later
- WiFi connection
- (optional) Mobile device

Compatibility
-
- Cozmo SDK 1.*
 
Known issues
-
- Local network availability is dependent on a lot of factors not covered by this program or its explanation. It should work if you know the computer's local ip-address and enter that in the address bar of another device's browser at port 5000 (i.e. 192.168.x.x:5000).
